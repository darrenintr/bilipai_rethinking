/// Single source of truth for the active video player. Hoists both
/// `PlayerController` and `WatchSession` out of `VideoDetailView`
/// so the player survives the view's dismissal: when the user taps
/// "back" (or swipes back) the inline surface goes away but the
/// `AVPlayer` keeps running, the history reporter keeps ticking,
/// and a floating mini-player surfaces at the bottom-trailing of
/// `RootView`.
///
/// Lifecycle
/// ---------
/// 1. `VideoDetailView` calls `bind(video:playback:repository:)` in
///    `.onChange(of: model.playback)`. The store creates a
///    `PlayerController` (which starts the local HLS proxy for VOD
///    DASH) and starts a `WatchSession`.
/// 2. `VideoDetailView.onDisappear` calls `detachInline()`. The
///    store flips `isShowingMiniPlayer` to `true`; the player keeps
///    playing. The `MiniPlayerOverlay` becomes visible.
/// 3. The user taps the mini-player; `MiniPlayerOverlay` calls
///    `router.openVideo(currentVideo)` which re-pushes the video
///    onto the navigation path. `VideoDetailView` re-mounts and
///    re-binds. `bind` is idempotent: if `currentVideo.id` matches
///    and the controller is alive, the store skips the rebuild, so
///    the playhead is continuous and `progress=0` is not re-fired.
/// 4. The user taps the mini-player's "X" — `close()` tears down the
///    controller and the watch session. The local HLS proxy is
///    stopped, and `isShowingMiniPlayer` flips back to `false`.

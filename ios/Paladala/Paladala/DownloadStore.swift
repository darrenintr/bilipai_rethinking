/// the "下载" tab; it does *not* own the bytes themselves —
/// those live under
/// `Caches/Paladala/Downloads/ready/{bvid}/`, and the store
/// points to them.
///
/// Concurrency model
/// -----------------
///
/// `DownloadStore` is a `@MainActor` `ObservableObject` —
/// SwiftUI views can observe `records` directly.  All disk
/// I/O hops onto a dedicated background `DispatchQueue` so
/// the main thread is never blocked by the manifest rewrite
/// (the manifest is small — order of 200 bytes per record —
/// but `Data.write(to:options: .atomic)` does an
/// `fsync`-equivalent and is unpredictable on a hot path).
///
/// The on-disk manifest is rewritten via `Data.write(to:
/// options: .atomic)` so a crash mid-write cannot leave the
/// user with a partial JSON file.  iOS replaces the file
/// atomically via a temporary + rename, and the old content
/// is recoverable from the OS-level recycle bin if the
/// rename never happens.
///
/// Storage location
/// ----------------
///
/// `Caches/` rather than `Documents/` — iOS may purge
/// `Caches/` under storage pressure, but the user's downloads
/// are re-derivable from the B 站 CDN so the trade-off is
/// correct.  `Documents/` would block iCloud backup of the
/// app, which we do not want for 70 MB video files.

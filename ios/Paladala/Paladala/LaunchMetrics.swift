/// one `OSSignposter.event`, and one `DiagnosticLogger.log` —
/// all O(1) and safe to call from any thread.

/// 1. `OSSignposter` (subsystem `app.paladala.ios`, category
///    `ColdStart`) — visible in Instruments → Time Profiler
///    (Signposts template) and `xcrun xctrace record`.
/// 2. `DiagnosticLogger.shared.log(.app, …)` — visible in the
///    in-app `LogViewerView` / `DeepDiagnosticReportView`, filter
///    by category `APP`.
/// 3. In-memory `[LaunchMilestone]` buffer + `dumpColdStartReport()`
///    — writes JSONL to `Application Support/Paladala/cold-start.jsonl`
///    when the `PALADALA_COLD_START_DUMP=1` env var is set, so the
///    diagnostic dump is opt-in and never grows on devices that
///    haven't asked for it.
///
/// Subsystem string
/// ----------------
/// We use the literal `app.paladala.ios` rather than the bundle
/// identifier so the signpost is filterable in Instruments even
/// before `Bundle.main` is fully resolved (the signposter is a
/// `static let` initialised lazily on first access). The subsystem
